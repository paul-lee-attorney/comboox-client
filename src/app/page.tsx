            <p><b>ComBoox</b> is a blockchain-based company book-entry platform designed for registering equity shares and corporate statutory books keeping, which is aimed to assist users to quickly establish a legal, secure, transparent and reliable smart contracts system, so as to enable investors, shareholders, executive officers, business partners to conduct legal acts around equity rights in a <b>self-service</b> mode, including share subscription, share transfer, share pledge, paying consideration, signing contracts, proposing, voting, nominating, inauguration and resignation etc.</p>

            <p><b>Different</b> from simple tokenization of equity certificates, ComBoox does <b>NOT</b> rely on legal documents to restrict off-chain behaviors so as to ensure the realization of rights and interests, instead, it uses smart contracts to fully control <b>ALL</b> activities of equity transactions and corporate governance, completely eliminating the possibilities of defaults or violations.</p>
            
            <p>Therefore, ComBoox can fundamentally solve the problems of <b>Insiders Control</b> or <b>Misleading Statements</b> that have plagued the capital markets for many years, and can completely realize:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>right holders may <b>directly</b> exercise rights;</li>
              <li>obligors have <b>no chance</b> to default; and</li>
              <li><b>real-time</b> information disclosure. </li>
            </ol>

            <p>By booking equity shares on-chain, investors may use <b>cryptocurrencies</b> to pay equitys consideration, which means effectively connecting the companyâ€™s equity shares to the trillion-dollar crypto markets, so that the companies may have an opportunity to have their equity value reevaluated and reconfirmed with the robust support of the huge liquidity.</p>
